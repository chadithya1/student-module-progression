# student-module-progression
This project is a student progression outcome predictor and visualizer. It takes input from the user for pass, defer, and fail credits, and determines the student's progression outcome (e.g., Progress, Module Trailer, Do Not Progress - Module Retriever, or Exclude). The results are displayed in a histogram chart using the graphics.py
